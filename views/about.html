                and landing
                supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.Musk has said
                the goals of
                SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to "change the world and help humanity". His goals
                include
                reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of
                human extinction
                by establishing a human colony on Mars.
